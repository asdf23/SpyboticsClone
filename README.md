SpyboticsClone
==============

A clone of Spybotics - a game originally created by lego. This game hopes to improve on that success

##Getting involved
I am looking for help and would appreicate your time. Here are some things you could do to help:

1. Take a look at the original game. Get a feeling for how it works and how you might improve on it. New characters, levels, changed game play. Lego took down the original however there is a working copy at  http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/
2. Install the FirefoxOS emulator. Although in theroy this should work in any browser it is targeted specifically for the Firefox OS. 
3. Using Firebug and Firefox's `Responsive Design View` you can debug and target different screen sizes
5. Most SVG icons and effects were made with Inkscape, there is a /Research directory that will not be included with this source code. Ask the developer for this Directory if you would like to add new icons or view the latest research and development.
4. Download the code and try it out on your own.

##TODO
Although I'll use the Issues list to track specific problems in general here are thing things that need to be done: 

1. New and more backgrounds
2. New and more icons (playable characters and enemies)
3. Music and sounds (there are none)
4. The world map
5. New and more Enemy AI's
6. Testing!

##Theming 
Where possible I will pay tribute to bash. For instance instead of a "GO" button I'll use "./battle.sh"

##Goals
* Use SVG instead of images. The only images are icons required by FirefoxOS. Shadows, effects, animations will all be done in SVG. Some text (for wrapping sizeing, scrolling uses HTML).
* Create a game that is playable on any screen size.
* Create a game about hacking to the point that the player tries to guess at how the code was implemented and uses it to his/her advantage (for instance enemy players move in order of top left reading to the to left then down by row the user could anticipate this order to his/her advantage, in later levels this order will be changeable.

##Legal
My goal is to make this game available to the FirefoxOS communtity. I will keep the source code open. However there are some legal issues regarding a clone of a game. I do not intend to copy the original game, nor any of it's art work (meaning: music, images, story line text). My hope is that the this game pays a complement to the success of the previous game, not to take credit nor take precedencee over it. However from a legal standpoint this game is a chess variant, it differs from chess in the following manners: 
* pieces can be accumulated over time by vaious means
* the goal is the defeat of all pieces (there are some exceptions to this)
* during a turn each player can move all his/her pieces
* there is a story line and world map which serves the purpose of combining multiple games into a single game
* the board can change during the play
* the pieces have different characteristics
* for the most part there are multiple AI's that the player is working against not a single "mind"
* there are rewards and punishment over the course of the story line that could extend to the next level.

There are many similar games in existance to this, most notably are tower defense games. These games have many of the same characterists such as: accumulated pieces, the goal of defeating all enemies, having a story line, having a world map, use of money or rewards, etc.. The theme of hacking is also common among many games perhaps the game Tron being the most well known.
