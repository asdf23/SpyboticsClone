SpyboticsClone
==============

A clone of Spybotics - a game originally created by lego. This game hopes to improve on that success

##Getting involved

I am looking for help and would appreicate donated time. Here are some things you could do to help:

1. Take a look at the original game. Get a feeling for how it works and how you might improve on it. New characters, levels, changed game play. Lego took down the original however there is a working copy at  http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/
2. Install the FirefoxOS emulator. Although in theroy this should work in any browser it is targeted specifically for the Firefox OS. 
3. Download the code and try it out on your own.

##TODO

Although I'll use the Issues list to track specific problems in general here are thing things that need to be done: 

1. New and more backgrounds
2. New and more icons (playable characters and enemies)
3. Music and sounds (there are none)
4. The world map
5. Enemy AI's
6. User interaction (currently it is impossible for the player to make a move)
7. There is a bug with animations
8. Testing!

##Legal

My goal is to make this game available to the FirefoxOS communtity. I will keep the source code open. However there are some legal issues regarding a clone of a game. I do not intend to copy any art work (music, images or otherwise) from the original. My hope is that the this game is a complement to the success of the previous game/
